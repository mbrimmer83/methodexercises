Exercises that introduced me to a number of javascript methods that I had not used before.
The exercises presented a number of challenges as we were not allowed to use any for or while loops
to complete the exercises.
  The reduce method.
  The map method.
  The filter method.
  The every method.
  The some method.
  The join method.
